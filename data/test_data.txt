Existence Precedes Essence 
… we can begin by saying that existentialism, in our sense of the word, is a 
doctrine that does render human life possible; a doctrine, also, which affirms 
that every truth and every action imply both an environment and a human 
subjectivity. … [A]t bottom, what is alarming in the doctrine that I am about to 
try to explain to you is – is it not? – that it confronts man with a possibility of 
choice. To verify this, let us review the whole question upon the strictly 
philosophic level. What, then, is this that we call existentialism? … 
The question is only complicated because there are two kinds of existentialists. 
There are, on the one hand, the Christians, amongst whom I shall name Jaspers 
and Gabriel Marcel, both professed Catholics; and on the other the existential 
atheists, amongst whom we must place Heidegger as well as the French 
existentialists and myself. What they have in common is simply the fact that 
they believe that existence comes before essence – or, if you will, that we must 
begin from the subjective. What exactly do we mean by that? 
If one considers an article of manufacture as, for example, a book or a paper
knife – one sees that it has been made by an artisan who had a conception of 
it; and he has paid attention, equally, to the conception of a paper-knife and to 
the pre-existent technique of production which is a part of that conception and 
is, at bottom, a formula. Thus the paper-knife is at the same time an article 
producible in a certain manner and one which, on the other hand, serves a 
definite purpose, for one cannot suppose that a man would produce a paper
knife without knowing what it was for. Let us say, then, of the paperknife that 
its essence – that is to say the sum of the formulae and the qualities which made 
its production and its definition possible – precedes its existence. The presence 
of such-and-such a paper-knife or book is thus determined before my eyes. 
Here, then, we are viewing the world from a technical standpoint, and we can 
say that production precedes existence.
